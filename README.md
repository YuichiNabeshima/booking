# Why I use Remix
I have never used Remix in practical work, but I am really intersted in it now.
Modern web development requires the frontend framework such as the Reactjs which makeing UI rich.
On the other hand, I prefer monolithic design than microservice one.
I thought that Remix can makes these two requirements of mine satisfied, and I have believed that it was true.
